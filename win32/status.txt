This document gives you an overview, which features are missing on
Win32 or Work in progress and is updated on regular basis.

If someone is working on the section, his or her name is listed behind
the entry in brackets.

Issues:
 o The Midgard PHP4 extension is not Zend-Thread-safe. Has to be
   investigated if this could become a problem.

Work to do:
 o Macros have to be modified for Win32. Lot of work, as the MS c++
   compiler is a bit ugly here.
